## Which Version of Java?

- Let's talk about a super important concept in the Java world, the LTS (Long-Term Support).
- This is a question that comes up all the time when choosing a Java Development Kit.
- What is the Java LTS?
  - Oracle, the "owners" of Java, release Java updates a few times, a year.
  - Special ones are designated "Long-Term Support" or LTS.
  - Regular releases are only supported for 6 months.
  - LTS on the other hand, receive extended security updates, bug fixes, and patches for years.
  - As a result, LTS releases are your rock-solid choice, especially for production environments and when learning Java.
- Why use a Java LTS version?
  - Stability: Companies need stable systems. LTS versions minimize surprises with bugs and security issues are already ironed out.
  - Support: If something goes wrong with an LTS version, you've got a longer window where official support and updates are guaranteed. This is vital for businesses.
  - Ecosystem: Libraries, tools, and frameworks often focus their support on LTS versions. That means a much smoother experience for you.
  - Regular versions: While they have cool new features, they lack long term support. Neat features eventually gets rolled into the next LTS version, making it the smarter choice for most production work.
- JDK 17 vs. JDK 21 - Does it matter?
  - You might think why are we using JDK 17 instead of JDK 21 which is the latest?
  - This is true but, Java LTS versions are designed for long-term use.
  - Companies don't instantly jump to the newest JDK.
  - This is because they prioritize testing, ensure compatibility with existing system, and just letting the LTS mature a bit.
- Summary:
  - For serious projects, learning with an LTS like JDK 17 is the way to go.
  - You will master core Java skills relevant across versions.
  - When a new LTS comes out, companies steadily migrate.
  - There is no need to chase every JDK update, especially because the cool, new, non-LTS features get merged into the next LTS anyway.
- Java LTS versions of the JDK are your friend when it comes to building reliable applications. That's why we will be using JDK 17 in this course.
